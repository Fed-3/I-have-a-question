Hi xiaopeng12138,

I wanted to ask you a quick question: i saw that you uploaded a config file for the kobra go on the klipper github, 
and I wanted to ask you how you were able to do that.

In particular, how did you manage to find the pin diagram if the board used by the printer?

Thanks a lot in advace for your time! :-)
